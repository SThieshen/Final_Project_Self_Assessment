# Final Project Individual Self Assessment

## Self-Assessment

During the course of the team's final project, my primary responsibility was creating the database for our project. Once our team finalized the topic of our project, we gathered a large dataset that required cleaning. One of the difficulties I encountered in working in a team setting was having the team provide input on what exactly they wanted included in the database, in terms of what they specifically wanted to analyze. Because our dataset was so large, I needed team members input on what they agreed was relevant. One challenge I encountered was improving my assertiveness. My team members changed the requirements they wanted in the database three different times, so I had to go back and modify it each time. During the third time of changing the database, I insisted the team take a moment and go through our dataset and determine what was relevant to our questions. Insisting on my team members clarifying what they needed from me was hard because I am not an assertive person, but I realized I was becoming frustrated with them and concise communication would resolve, which it did. Once we clearly communicated needs and expectations, I was able to provide the database they needed for the dashboard and machine learning model.


## Project and Team Summary (60 points)
The project summary should be a two paragraph written analysis that summarizes the project, illustrates the teamwork of the group, and documents lessons learned. The summary should be written as if to be used in an interview or cover letter, and includes all of the following:

Communication protocols used, including any challenges, how they were resolved, and what they would do differently next time
Team strengths, including tips and tricks they would want to share with a new cohort kicking off the project
Topic addressed
Machine learning model used
Results of the analysis
